Hybrid Cryptography Requirements:

Sender
- Session Key Generator (One Time)
- Secret Message (Plaintext)


Receiver
- RSA Key Generator (Public Private)


Steps:
1. Sender. Generate new one time session key (Symmetric)
2. Receiver. Generate new Public & Private key (Asymmetric)
3. Sender. Use the Receiver's Public key to Encrypt the one time session key
4. Sender. Sends the encrypted session key to Receiver
5. Receiver Decrypt the Sender's Message/Session key using his/her private key
-  Receiver obtain the Sender's Secret One Time Session Key

6. Receiver sends confirmation message to Sender
7. Sender Decrypt the confirmation message from Receiver

8. Now Sender & Receiver already had the Secret One Time Session Key safely. They now can send a larger message way more secure using the Symmetric Cryptography System since The One Time Session Key for the Symmetrical Cryptography has been send to The Receiver safely
